ScifiNotifications
==================

This Kanboard plugin provides customized email notifications for Project
SCIFI. Generally, it makes things feel more like GitHub. Here are the
main things it does:

- Whitelists certain event types for notifications.
- Customizes email bodies and subject lines.
- Disables setting of the "Reply to" header.

Some things we would like to do in the future (here or in  another
plugin):

- Use a "subscriber" system for notifications: users get notifications
  for projects and tasks they subscribe to, and they are automatically
  subscribed when they create, edit, comment on, or are assigned to a
  task.
